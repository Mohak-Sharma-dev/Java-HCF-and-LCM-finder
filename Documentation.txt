This is the documentation file for the project, divided into three sections:

Prime number Generator:
-Which functions are used.
-Why were those functions used.
-When  
-What does this achieve/what is done differently/What were the different challenges and HOW were they addressed/overcame~

This sections provides the documentation for The prime number generator,
Which is essenciall for Finding HCF and LCM.

Here's a summary of the functions/methods used (Appart form the basic beginner  stuff like setters/getters/ and constructors.):

Overloaded functions(I'll explain later):

1. arrayListGenerator(int lowerbound,int upperbound)
2. arrayListGenerator(int upperbound)

Non-Overloaded FUnctions:

3. isPrime(int integertocheck, int primecheckedagainst, int forloopIteration)
4. run()
5. primenumberGenerator(ArrayList<Integer> listofIntegers)

Before we begin, I want you to visualize how you would have generated a list of primes and write it down somewhere.

It is important, if you're reading this, you just begun programming. But it is important we define your logic first then refine it.

Jumping to solutions is fruitless (Saying this from personal experience).

Now that your done that, let's move on to generating a normal array of integers. we do that by:
